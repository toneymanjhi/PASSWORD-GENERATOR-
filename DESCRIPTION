In this password generator GUI application, we are going to use two 3 modules. Firstly, the Tkinter module for creating an application window. Secondly, pyperclip module for copying the generated password. Now, remember these two modules are not inbuilt modules. So you have to install them using the pip install command. The third and final module we are going to use is a random module to generate the random password finally. The quick logic for this GUI application is going to be like this: Firstly, We will import the necessary modules. Then we will create the application window. After that, we will generate a random password and copy it. Afterward, In the end, we will create some buttons to make our password generator application more interactive for the user. Because after all, itâ€™s a GUI.
